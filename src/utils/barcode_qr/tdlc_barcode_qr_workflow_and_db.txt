TDLC Barcode/QR Workflow Spec

- Barcodes and QR codes are always auto-generated by backend or frontend code, not pasted manually.
- Barcode must encode Order No. and SKU/Product Code.
- QR code must link to product or order page (e.g., https://www.thednalabstore.com/order/ORD-2025-001).
- Code generation happens automatically at time of product/order creation.
- DB design:
  Product Table: SKU, ProductName, QR_URL, BarcodeValue
  Order Table: OrderNo, SKU, QR_URL, BarcodeValue, etc.
- At invoice/label/receipt/packing slip generation, system generates and embeds images automatically.
- Use any of: bwip-js (Node), python-barcode, react-barcode, tec-it.com API, or similar.
- For warehouse, POS, and CMS—always scan, never type!
- All future TDLC automation, website, POS, and CMS must sync QR/barcode by code, not manual images.

API suggestions:
  - QR: quickchart.io/qr, goqr.me API
  - Barcode: barcode.tec-it.com API, bwip-js self-hosted

Plug these code samples into any production system for instant TDLC compliance.
