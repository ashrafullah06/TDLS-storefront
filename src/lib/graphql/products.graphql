# src/lib/graphql/fragments/product.graphql

# Minimal, schema-safe product fragment that matches Strapi v4 patterns.
# NOTE:
# - Product fields like name/title vary by project. We only include fields we
#   KNOW exist from your error hints: cost_price and categories (plural).
# - You can add more fields later once Codegen succeeds.

fragment ProductBasics on Product {
  cost_price
  categories {
    data {
      id
      attributes {
        name
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
